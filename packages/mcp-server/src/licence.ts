/**
 * Offline licence-token verification.
 *
 * A token is a compact, signed, self-describing string:
 *
 *   cognium-lic-v1.<base64url(JCS payload)>.<base64url(Ed25519 signature)>
 *
 * The signature covers the **canonical** payload (RFC 8785, `./jcs.ts`), not
 * the bytes the payload happened to arrive in, so a token survives being
 * re-encoded on the way. The same token is the api.cognium.net key and the
 * hosted proxy credential, so the format is a cross-surface contract: the
 * prefix is versioned, and a change to the shape is a prefix bump.
 *
 * `kid` names the key that signed it, so keys can be rotated without
 * invalidating tokens signed by the previous one — a verifier simply keeps
 * both. It is inside the payload, and therefore signed.
 *
 * Verification is **offline and read-only**: an Ed25519 public key, no
 * network, no cache, no state written anywhere. Nothing here phones home,
 * and nothing here is secret — a verification key is published on purpose.
 * The private half never appears in this repository or in any published
 * package.
 *
 * Deliberately *not* here: entitlement enforcement, metering and revocation.
 * Those live at the issuer and the hosted endpoints, never in a binary the
 * user runs.
